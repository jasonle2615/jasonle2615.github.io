# Jason Le's Portfolio

This is my home page! My name is Jason Le and I am a student at CSUF and my major is Computer Engineering. I plan on graduating in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my three favorite labs because it gives me a fresh start into the coding world in Computer Science. I learned common codes throughout future labs like std::cout, and return. I also learned the basic commands on the terminal, like cd, ls, git add, git push, etc.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 is my second favorite lab because it gave me the understanding about using arguments and putting them in code. It allowed me to identify what arguments I should name and the amount of them too.

* Lab 11 

    Lab 11 Part 2 is my third favorite lab because it allows me to use simple code of boolean operators. Although there isn't a lot of code work to do, I understood what to write. I can say this is the only lab that has a simpler way to write boolean operators.
